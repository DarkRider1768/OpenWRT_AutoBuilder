OpenWRT_AutoBuilder
===================
This is a script meant to simplify the preparation and building of OpenWRT firmware.

The idea is to be able to setup a headless system (Say, a debian jail on a FreeNAS system) and allow a cron job to do 
all the work.

*Currently, I have only made progress for Debian systems and even that is no where near complete. Everyone is more than welcome
to try and pound some of the stuff out in the issue tracker. I'll test things and pull them into the project if they look good.
